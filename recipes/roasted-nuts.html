        <p>
            We eat a good share of nuts in our home, especially as salad toppers (like my Crunchy Asian Cabbage Salad and my Simple Quinoa Salad), in our favorite granola recipe, the Peanut Butter Power Balls we eat non-stop, and as another couple of snacks – my Cinnamon Sugar Candied Pecans and the Best Candied Walnuts Recipe. Nuts are a great 
            source of protein and energy, which is key to sustaining an active lifestyle.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure the nuts. You’ll need an equal ratio of almonds to cashews.</li>
        <li>Prepare honey mixture. In a microwaveable bowl, heat the honey up for about 30 seconds. Add the cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and salt to the honey, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture over nuts. Pour the honey and seasoning mixture over the nuts, coating well.</li>
        <li>Spread on a sheet pan. Spread the prepared nuts evenly on a baking sheet prepared with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake. Bake in a 350 degree preheated oven for 15 – 20 minutes, or until nuts are fragrant and nicely browned. Be careful to NOT burn them!</li>
        <li>Add sugar. Remove the nuts from the oven, and sprinkle the brown sugar over top.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly. As soon as you can safely handle the nuts (just 5 or so minutes), break the nuts apart, and remove from the parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Serve! You can serve these nuts warm or cold. We normally store them in the freezer, and they are good straight away!</li>
    </ol>
