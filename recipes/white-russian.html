    <h4>
        <p>
            A White Russian is a cocktail made with vodka,
            coffee liqueur and cream served with ice in an old fashioned glass.
            Often milk, half and half, or cream liqueur will be used as an alternative 
            to cream.
        </p>
        <p>
            A rich and satisfying after-dinner drink blended from vodka, coffee liqueur,
            and light cream, the White Russian could almost be said to have it all. A one-stop source of alcohol, sugar, caffeine,
            and milk fat, the only legal substance it lacks is nicotine.
